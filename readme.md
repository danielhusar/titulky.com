# Titulky.com chrome extension

> Remove annoying countdown in the popup until you can download subtitles


## Installation

Load it as unpacked extension. (I'm not going to submit it to chrome store)

## What it does

If you haven't reached 25 downloads per day, subtitles will be auto downloaded after clicking on the link.
If you have reached 25 downloads per day, popup with captcha will appear, but after filling captcha you have no longer to wait few seconds and can directly download subtitles.
